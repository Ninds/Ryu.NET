# RyuCsharp

使用 C# 实现的 [Ryu](https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu) ，一个高性能浮点数转换为字符串的算法。


Ryu, implemented by C#, a high-performance algorithm for converting floats to strings.

This repo was forked from  [RyuCsharp](https://github.com/Dogwei/RyuCsharp) which itself was derived from [Ryu](https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu).

We have added some unit tests generated from the output from Remy Oudompheng's iterator over floating-point numbers which are hard to convert from/to decimal form. [fptest](https://github.com/remyoudompheng/fptest)
